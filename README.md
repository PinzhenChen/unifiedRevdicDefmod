# Unified Reverse Dictionary and Definition Modelling 

This repository contains the code for our research on a multi-task model in:
- "A unified model for reverse dictionary and definition modelling" at AACL-IJCNLP 22
  - model details, experiments on two relatively high-resource English datasets, human evaluation, training objectives.
- "Edinburgh at SemEval-2022 Task 1: Jointly fishing for word embeddings and definitions" [[pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.8/)] at SemEval 2022
  - experiments and analysis on five languages and three types of embeddings, in a low-resource scenario; discussions on the tasks.
